# DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT üìä
# Data Analysis for Market Recovery and Profitability Enhancement in Atliq Grands
_Industry: Hospitality_ üèñÔ∏è

## Context:

Atliq Grands is a distinguished hotel chain with a 20-year legacy in India, comprising 25 hotels strategically located in the country's four major cities. These establishments operate under seven exclusive brands that pride themselves on offering five-star experiences, catering to a discerning audience and targeting a high-value market.

## Challenge:
Despite its strong track record, Atliq Grands has experienced a decline in market share and profits in the luxury and business segment. In response, the chain has chosen to incorporate data analysis as a solution to regain its position in this highly competitive landscape.

## Project Approach:

- Utilized Data: To address this project, comprehensive information was collected from the database and organized into five key tables: "dim date" (temporal dimensions), "dim hotels" (hotel information), "dim rooms" (room details), "fact bookings" (reservation records), and "fact aggregated booking" (aggregated reservation data). This dataset covers the period from April to July 2022, encompassing over 130,000 documented reservations and around 54,000 customer reviews.

- Technologies Used: For data analysis, the Power BI tool was employed due to its ability to process information using Power Query and effectively present findings through interactive dashboards. This enables direct communication of results in relevant managerial meetings.

## Insights:

- Altaiq Line Cancellations: A substantial increase in cancellations is observed in the last two weeks of July, particularly in the Altaiq By and Altaiq Grands lines. This may be attributed to potential logistical issues related to room availability, as cancellations increased by over 100% during that period.

- Altaiq Seasons Reputation and Services: Despite operating only in Mumbai and generating lower revenues, Altaiq Seasons' reputation is being affected by negative customer ratings. This underscores the importance of significantly improving service quality to maintain a reputation consistent with the brand, despite targeting a less affluent clientele.

- Seasonal Transition and Reservation Decrease: The end of summer and the onset of the rainy season mark the end of high vacation demand from both domestic and foreign clients, resulting in a noticeable decrease in hotel reservations.

- Reservation Platforms and Cancellations: Both online and offline booking platforms experienced a high cancellation rate due to reduced hotel capacity caused by seasonal changes and staffing availability.

- Reduced Hotel Capacity: During the last two weeks of July, an 80% reduction in available hotel capacity was evident, leading to a proportionate decrease in guest-generated revenue.

- Steady Hotel Occupancy: Despite the challenges, hotel occupancy rates have remained consistent at around 60%, possibly indicating a solid underlying demand.
